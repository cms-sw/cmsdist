- Description:
  HighFive is a modern header-only C++11 friendly interface for libhdf5.
  HighFive supports STL vector/string, Boost::UBLAS, Boost::Multi-array, Eigen and Xtensor. 
  It handles C++ from/to HDF5 with automatic type mapping. 
  HighFive does not require additional libraries (see dependencies) and supports both 
  HDF5 thread safety and Parallel HDF5 (contrary to the official hdf5 cpp)
